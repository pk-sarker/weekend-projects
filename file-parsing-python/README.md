# The Gringotts Bank Integration

## Introduction

XYZ Org. is on a mission to create owners and in this pursuit it turns out that _witches and wizards_ also own shares in companies. They can _manage_ their shares using XYZ Org., but they are not able to buy/sell shares because they uniquely use **Gringotts Bank**. XYZ Org. has not yet built an integration with Gringotts.

XYZ Org. does already integrate with two other banks: SweetBank and AcmeFinancials. Part of this integration involves parsing transaction data and generating reports. The current codebase can already parse files and print reports for those two; we need to **add support for the Gringotts transaction data**.

## The Problem

Update the provided code to recognize a new input file format and **print out a small report** identifying the account whose **average withdrawal amount** was largest. In case there is more than one account, print all.

Refactor the existing codebase as appropriate to support this new integration.

You can print the current reports as follows:
```
python3 printReport.py acme_bank
python3 printReport.py sweet_bank
```
`assets/gringotts_5b36864e-8089-40f7-8d3d-25c14715656d.txt` is a sample test file provided.

### File Format

After much trouble, the goblins at Gringotts handed us the specification for the file format:

Each file contains a collection of **Transaction Batches**, each of which is associated with a collection of **Transactions**. The file format looks roughly like this:
```
[Transaction Batch ID]
[Transaction]
[Transaction]
[Transaction...]
[Transaction Batch ID]
[Transaction...]
[Transaction Batch ID...]
...
```

Here's an example:
```

USD100
```

#### Transaction Batch ID
```
GTTB0001213929322
├──┘├───────────┘
│   └ Batch ID (13 numbers)
└ Bank Identifier (4 letters, always "GTTB")
```

#### Transaction

Each Transaction is a block of 4 lines in the input data:
```
[Transaction ID]
[Source Account]
[Destination Account]
[Transfer Amount]
```

##### Transaction ID
```
c74e460d-e3b3-4f5b-b84e-b3347dde04dd
├──────────────────────────────────┘
└ UUID v4 (8-4-4-4-12 hex digits)
```

#### Source Account
```
128172817HP991819309
├───────┘├┘├───────┘
│        │ └ Account ID: (9 numbers)
│        └ Account Holder (2 letters)
└ Bank ID (9 numbers)
```

##### Destination Account

Same as [Source Account](#source-account).

##### Transfer Amount

The amount of money _withdrawn_ from the Source Account and _deposited_ to the Desination Account.
```
USD100000
├─┘├────┘
│  └ Transferred Amount (in cents)
└ Currency Code (3 letters, always `USD`) (ISO 4217 standard)
```

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated along these axes:
- Is its output **correct**?
- Is the code **clear** and **readable**? (the current version of the code is far from it)
- Is the code of **production quality**?
- Is the code easy to test?
- Does the code handle large data sets?
- Does the code demonstrate good `git` commit hygiene?

## Submitting Your Work

Submit your code as a zip file (no GitHub links, please!) using the submission link provided by your recruiter. Name your file `YOURINITIALS-XYZ Org..zip`, e.g. `AB-XYZ Org..zip` or `AB-XYZ Org..tar.gz`

Your submission should also include a `SUBMISSION.txt` describing any key design decisions and documenting any assumptions you made.

**Your submission should also include a file called `solution.txt` with the output of applying your solution to the sample Gringotts data in the `assets` directory.**

So we can ensure that your assignment remains anonymous during grading, please do not include your name anywhere in your code or in your `SUBMISSION.txt`.

Ensure all your changes are committed, and then run these two commands from the directory root to zip your solution with an anonymized git history:
```
git filter-branch --env-filter '
  export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="anonymous"
  export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="anonymous"
  export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="anonymous"
  export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="anonymous"
  ' -- --all

tar -czvf AB-XYZ Org..tar.gz \
  --exclude="*.pyc" \
  --exclude="__pycache__" \
  --exclude="venv" \
  --exclude=".venv" \
  --exclude=".idea" \
  --exclude=".python-version" \
  . \
  SUBMISSION.txt \
  solution.txt
```
